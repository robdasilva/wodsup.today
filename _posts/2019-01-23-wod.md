- **_Squat Potato_** (TC 4)

  > Squatting in a circle, athletes pass around a medicine ball as long as the music plays. Once the music stops, the athlete currently holding the ball in his hands is out and has to hold a plank outside of the circle for the rest of the game. The direction in which the medicine ball is passed around alternates beetween clockwise and counter-clockwise every time the music stops. The winner has to do 10 burpees, proloning the end of the plank hold for all others.
