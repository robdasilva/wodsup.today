# Tabata Tuesday

Tabata Tuesday aims to focus on establishing and holding full body tension for short bursts of maximum efforts over an extended period of time.

- **_Dowel Duel_**

  > With each partner standing on a bumper plate about a meter apart both hold one end of a dowel. The objective of the game is to get their partner to either give up their grip on the dowel, or to fall off their plate. Every minute the game is varied by having the partners switch hands or stand on only one leg.
