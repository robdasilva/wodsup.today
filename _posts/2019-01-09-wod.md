- **_Funnel Tag_**

  > Divide the class into groups of 6 to 8 athletes. Each group chooses one athlete to be the tagger and one athlete to be the target. The group faces each other in a circle with their arms entwined, and spins to the left or right in an attempt to keep the target as far from the tagger as possible. The tagger must remain outside the circle, sprinting around it in pursuit of the target. If the tagger successfully tags the target, all athletes in the circle must do 5 burpees. If the tagger is unable to tag the target for a predetermined amount of time (25-30 seconds), the tagger must complete 5 burpees. Choose a new tagger and target for each round – if the tagger was successful the target becomes the new tagger, otherwise the tagger becomes the new target.
