# Full-body Friday

Full-body Friday aims to put a strain on the whole body by combining versatile functional movements and working through the exercises without rest.

- **45 Minutes** â€“ in teams of 3

  - 50 Sandbag Thrusters
  - 100 Push-Ups
  - 150 Sit-Ups
  - 200 Sandbag Squats
  - 150 Wall Ball Shots
  - 100 Box Jumps
  - 50 Burpees

  > One team member rows 500 meters while the other two work on the exercises in an "I go, You go" pattern. Once the first team member completes the rowing, the next one rows 500 meters and the other two continue to work on the exercises. So at all times there has to be one member rowing and the other two work chipper-style through the exercises. Whenever the rower pauses or during transition times the other team members must pause as well.
