# Tabata Tuesday

Tabata Tuesday aims to focus on establishing and holding full body tension for short bursts of maximum efforts over an extended period of time.

- **_Cone Grab_** (TC 6)

  > Line up half as many cones as there are athletes and have two athletes per cone stand in an active squat position on either side of the line. If there is an uneven number of athletes in class one may miss a turn. Call out body parts (eg. head, shins, knees, back) the athletes have to place their hands on as fast as possible or randomly call out "CONE!" for the athletes to grab their cone faster than their partner. The partner who fails to grab the cone does a movement penalty (eg. 5 air squats). After every round all athletes move one cone to the left.
