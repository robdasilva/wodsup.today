- **For time** â€“ in teams of 3

  - Move 8000m / 6000m
  - Lift 8000kg / 6000kg
  - Carry 24000kg / 18000kg (per meter)

  > As a team you have to accumulate the prescribed sum of weights and distances. Sum up all the meters you either run, row or ski, every weight you lift from ground to overhead, and weight you carry for every meter. You can choose between only doing few reps with heavy weights, more reps with fewer weights or a combination of both.

  > Example:
  >
  > - Rowing 500 meters adds 500 meters to your teams quota of moving.
  > - Ten ground-to-overheads with a 25kg sandbag count as 250kg of lifting.
  > - Carrying a 50kg sandbag for ten meters equals 500kg per meter.

  > If needed, the workout can also be scaled for a team of 4, which would have to move 11000m, lift 11000kg and carry 21000kg per meter.
