# Full-body Friday

Full-body Friday aims to put a strain on the whole body by combining versatile functional movements and working through the exercises without rest.

- **_Partner Relay Race_** - in teams of 3 (TC 6)

  > Divide the class into teams of three and give every team an equal amount of objects – bumper plates, kettlebells, sandbags, slam balls, ... – they have to carry to the other side of the gym faster than their opponents. Only one partner per team may move at a time. The winning team may pick any bodyweight movement the losing team has to perform 10-20 reps of as a penalty.

- **Activation** – in teams of 3 (TC 6)

  > In a hollow position one partner squeezes their stretched-out arms and legs together with the other two partners trying to push them apart.

- **6 Rounds** (3min WORK/3min REST)

  - 50m Sandbag Carry (bodyweight)
  - 10 Burpee Box Jump-Overs
  - ME Assault Bike for calories

  > Athletes start in heats of up to three every 60-90 seconds depending on class size.
