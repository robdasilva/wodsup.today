Divide the class into teams of three and give every team an equal amount of objects – bumper plates, kettlebells, sandbags, slam balls, ... – they have to carry to the other side of the gym faster than their opponents. Only one partner per team may move at a time. The winning team may pick any bodyweight movement the losing team has to perform 10-20 reps of as a penalty.
