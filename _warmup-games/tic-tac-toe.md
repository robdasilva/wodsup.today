title: Tic Tac Toe
---

With a three-by-three field set up behind a row of boxes on one side of the gym, the class is divided into two teams on the other side of the gym. Line up two different colored rows of kettlebells between the teams starting line and the playing field. One athlete per team – starting from a lying position on the floor – may run over to the playing field, picking up a kettlebell on the go and place it on an empty field on the board. Once the athlete returns to their starting position the next team member may start. Like normal tic-tac-toe, the object of the game is to get 3 in a row.
