title: Plank Race
---

Place an uneven number of kettlebells in a straight line – about shoulder-width apart – from the approximate center of the gym floor to one end. From the other end of the gym two athletes at a time race down sideways on either side of the line, maintaining a plank position at all times. Athletes tip over the first standing kettlebell they reach towards their teams side and duck walk back as soon as possible. Once they cross the starting line, the next athlete of their team may go. The team with more kettlebells tipped over to their side wins and resets the line of kettlebells. The winning team may pick a penalty for the losing team.
